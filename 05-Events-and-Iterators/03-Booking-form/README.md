## Background & Objectives

This is what you'll build in this challenge:

![Dynamic form Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/booking-form.gif)

We want to **update the form's UI** when a user clicks on the `-` / `+` buttons.

Submitting the form is not expected to have any effects.

Time to play with [`datasets`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset)!

### Setup

Let's launch a local webserver by running:

```bash
serve
```

Then, open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Specs

Open the `index.html` in your browser.

### Add participants

The page displays a booking form that we want to make **dynamic**. When the user clicks on the `+` / `-` buttons, we want to:

- Update the counter
- Update the price displayed on the submit button
- Update the value of the read-only input (in cents)

To do so, take a good look at the `index.html` file, especially **the `data-` attributes** that hold precious values to help you!

Remember how we select HTML elements? Once you have selected one with `document.querySelector()` you can access its data attributes like so:

```html
  <div class="card" data-id="1"></div>
```

```js
  let card = document.querySelector(".card")
  console.log(card.dataset.id) // Will print out "1" on the console
```

Once you target the correct HTML elements and understand how to access their datasets, you will be able to start coding the desired behavior!

### Enable the minus (`-`)

The `-` button should not allow `0` or negative values! When you want to "disable" a link you can prevent it's default behavior like this:

```js
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
});

```

Improve your form's UX by:

- Toggling `-` link: **enable** the link when the number of participants is **`>= 2`** and **disable** it otherwise (the counter should never reach `0` nor negative values)!
- Hiding the input (you may want to look into [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)), it should not be visible to your users in your form's final version!

This challenge is **hard**, discuss it with your buddy and do it step by step, with pseudo-code! What `HTML` elements need to be changed? In what order? Which ones have values that might need to be updated and which ones should remain constant? Hash this out and remember that you can always break your code up into smaller chunks (think arrow functions ðŸ˜‰)

There aren't any tests for this exercise, but we check your style! So run `rake`.

## Resources

- To add / remove an HTML attribute to / from an element, you may want to look at [`removeAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute) and [`setAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)
- You can get all the attributes of an HTML element by calling the [`.attributes` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes) on the element
